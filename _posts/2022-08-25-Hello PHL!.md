# PHL Stuff

This would be about the PHL.

## Where is the ON button?

* On the bottom
* On the top
* In the middle

### Here's some code

```c++
#include <stdio.h>
int a;
int PHL;
main(){

}
```

```yaml
key: value
key2: value2
```

```terminal
mha.mhachain.overlapadd.mhachain.fftfilterbank.f = [250 500 1000 1500 2000 3000 4000 6000 8000]

mha.mhachain.overlapadd.mhachain.fftfilterbank.fscale = log

mha.mhachain.overlapadd.mhachain.fftfilterbank.ovltype = rect

mha.mhachain.overlapadd.mhachain.fftfilterbank.ftype = center
```
